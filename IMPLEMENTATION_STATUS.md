## Build and Run Status - 2025-03-22

The application now builds and runs with enhanced UI functionality for visualizing audio components. Various errors were fixed in the codebase to get to a working state.

### Recent UI Additions
- Implemented a tabbed interface with views for Synthesis, Effects, Sequencer, Mixer, and Settings
- Created visualization components for oscillator waveforms, envelope shapes, and filter responses
- Set up the architecture for connecting UI components to audio engine modules
- Implemented a timer-based system for real-time visualization updates
- Created placeholder panels for future functionality implementation

### Previously Fixed Issues

#### ProjectManager.cpp
- Updated deprecated `browseForFileToSave` method with `launchAsync`
- Replaced deprecated `writeToFile` with `writeTo` using FileOutputStream
- Fixed error handling and file path management

#### MixerChannel Components
- Fixed SendControl struct to use `std::unique_ptr` for UI components (Slider, Label) as they are non-copyable
- Updated references to SendControl's components to use pointer syntax
- Fixed deprecated Font constructor with modern FontOptions approach

#### Oscillator.cpp
- Replaced deprecated `getParameter()` calls with direct access to parameter atomics
- Implemented missing parameter accessor functions (setPulseWidth, setDetune, setGain and their getters)

#### Delay.cpp and Reverb.cpp
- Added missing `setMix()` and `getMix()` implementations for proper integration with effect chain

#### MainComponent.cpp
- Significantly simplified implementation to identify and isolate initialization issues
- Added comprehensive debug logging throughout initialization process
- Implemented proper exception handling with try-catch blocks
- Simplified audio processing callbacks to minimum viable implementation
- Removed or stubbed complex functionality until core app is stable

### Current State

The application now:
- Successfully builds without errors
- Launches and displays a window with enhanced UI elements
- Shows tabbed interface with specialized views for different functions
- Features visualization components for oscillator, envelope, and filter
- Has functional synth components including oscillators, envelopes, and filters
- Provides real-time visual feedback of audio parameter changes
- Logs initialization process for debugging

### Known Issues and Warnings

- There are multiple "override" warnings in Reverb.h where virtual methods aren't properly marked with override keyword
- Some function parameters are marked as unused
- Advanced audio routing with filter envelope is not fully integrated into the main audio path yet
- UI component integration with actual audio engine instances needs completion

### Next Steps

1. Complete UI-Engine integration:
   - Finalize connections between visualization components and audio engine
   - Implement parameter controls for all visualization components
   - Create interaction between UI controls and audio parameters

2. Implement Phase 2: Effects Processing
   - Create the Effects Framework with standard interface
   - Implement EffectsChain for routing audio through multiple effects
   - Add parameter automation framework
   - Create preset management system
   - Implement parallel/serial routing options

3. Complete remaining UI panels:
   - Finish Effects panel with visualization and controls
   - Implement Sequencer panel with pattern editing
   - Complete Mixer panel with channel strips and routing
   - Develop Settings panel with global preferences
